Model-based Interface for Remote Interaction in Mixed Reality.

The project is to build a TUM campus model-based interface for remote interaction in mixed reality.

This gives the user a distant and holistic perception of the entire environment and allows them to interact with the model from this perspective. Unlike typical virtual reality applications, users do not have to be confined to a small first-person view. 

Remote interactions include scaling, panning and adding points to display it in a realistic environment. Users can adjust the model by scaling and panning. It enables that when a sphere marker is added to the scaled-down campus model, another sphere marker is added to the real environment at the corresponding location on the model.
